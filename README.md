# Module Helper
  Trying to find a way to automate reading the offline docs
  of the packages in pip and conda 
  (a bad start)

## Usage
- Clone it, run it
- Ongoing, so incomplete and doesn't work as expected

## Bugs
- Only the listing of the packages are done, docs need to be formatted
- package name is not equal to import name so make a custom prompt for user to import the package
- conda and pip ain't sticking well when opening docs (only conda works now)


## TODOs
- fix everything
- cleaner UI with dropdown arrows inside docs -_-
